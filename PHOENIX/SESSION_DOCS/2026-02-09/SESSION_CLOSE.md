## SESSION SUMMARY

### Work Completed This Session

**1. FORGE Competitive Intelligence Report**
- Reviewed 14+ published prompt engineering frameworks (COSTAR, RISEN, RACE, CRISPE, RHODES, CLEAR, TCRTE, RTF, Five S, FOCUS, RACEF, PROMPT, RHODES, CREATE-Birss)
- Analyzed 6+ published books, 7+ software tools, and the @getintoai viral Instagram post
- Confirmed FORGE is architecturally unique — no competitor combines interactive teaching, quality gating, protocol injection, multi-agent routing, and reverse prompt construction
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: CREATE acronym collision with Dave Birss (published 2023, LinkedIn Learning, cited by Georgia Tech, U of Michigan, multiple academic institutions)
- Proposed ANVIL + ASSAY as replacement names (metallurgy brand family alignment with FORGE)
- Designed 50-prompt test harness for proving 50% response authentication improvement
- Delivered complete competitive positioning strategy

### Decisions Made
- CREATE/CAKE must be renamed (naming collision confirmed)
- ANVIL (input quality) + ASSAY (output quality) proposed — decision pending Principal approval
- Reverse prompt builder identified as FORGE's killer differentiator
- Test harness design approved for parallel development track

### Files Pushed to GitHub This Session
- `FORGE/FORGE_COMPETITIVE_INTELLIGENCE_2026-02-09.md` — Full competitive analysis
- `PHOENIX/SESSION_DOCS/2026-02-09/SESSION_CLOSE.md` — This document

### Memory Updated
- Added: FORGE rebrand needed, CREATE name conflict with Dave Birss (2023), proposed ANVIL+ASSAY, reverse builder and test harness priority
