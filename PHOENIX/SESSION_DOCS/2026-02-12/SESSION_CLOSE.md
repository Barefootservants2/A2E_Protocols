# PHOENIX SESSION CLOSE — February 12, 2026

**Session:** Market hours crisis response + protocol gap closure

---

## KEY EVENTS

1. **Live Market Crisis Response:** Tech selloff (DOW -460, NASDAQ -399) hit silver positions.
   - SIVR: Stopped out at $75.71
   - PSLV: Stopped out at $26.00 (~$746 loss)
   - AG: Dropped to $21.97, recovered to $23.35+
   - SIL: $98.84, within $0.84 of $98 stop
   - Day damage: -$2,895 (-$2,149 unrealized + -$746 realized)

2. **8-Sector Blind Scan Executed:** Full macro scan identified PRIMARY DRIVER as tech sector rotation (Cisco -11%), NOT metals-specific fundamentals. This changed the response from "thesis failing" to "thesis intact, wrong sector catching fire."

3. **Thesis Validation:** Checked all kill signals — none triggered. UBS, Goldman, Deutsche Bank all maintaining bullish gold/silver targets. Shanghai premium at record $8/oz.

4. **Split Deployment Strategy:** $5K today (AG), $5K post-CPI (Friday). Leaves $2-3K cash reserve.

5. **IRA Settlement:** $346,848 deposited. T+2 to T+4 settlement = Tuesday Feb 18 earliest. Forced wait through CPI/FOMC/earnings = advantage.

6. **GATE 9.5 EARNINGS CHECK Created:** Discovered CRITICAL earnings cluster Feb 17-19:
   - Feb 17: HL (Hecla) — after close (but President's Day?)
   - Feb 18: PAAS + CDE — after close + FOMC minutes same day
   - Feb 19: AG — TBA (direct holding, 925 shares)
   - 24.9% of SIL by weight reports within 48 hours
   - Modified deployment: second $5K tranche goes to SIL, not AG

7. **AG Stop Set:** $20.00 (9% below entry, below intraday low, protects through earnings)

8. **COMPREHENSIVE REPO AUDIT:** Identified 10 missing protocol documents from last 3 days. All created and pushed in this session.
