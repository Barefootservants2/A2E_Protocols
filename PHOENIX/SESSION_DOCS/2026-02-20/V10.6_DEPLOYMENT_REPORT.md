## WHAT v10.6 ADDS TO EACH AGENT

### MICHA (CIO) — CASCADE ENFORCER
- 9-lock FIDELITY (added Evidence+NULL, Attestation to existing 7)
- Runs Cascade qualification on every opportunity before recommending
- Produces CASCADE SUMMARY OUTPUT with all 8 gate pass/fail
- Enforces Track 1/2 split (80/20)
- Mandates trade logging to trade_log.json
- No regret re-entry enforcement

### URIEL (CEO) — GATE 4: REGIME ALIGNMENT
- Regime declaration (Risk-On/Neutral/Risk-Off) feeds Cascade Gate 4
- Bull signal in Risk-Off regime = higher bar to pass
- Consensus voter in Gate 5 (strategic perspective)

### COLOSSUS (CTO) — GATE 8: TRAJECTORY ALIGNMENT
- Entry timing assessment: GO / WAIT / PASS
- Final gate before trade qualification completes
- Good thesis at wrong time = loss. COLOSSUS decides timing.
- Consensus voter in Gate 5 (technical perspective)

### HANIEL (CPO) — GATE 2/3 DATA FEEDER
- Research signals feed convergence check (Gate 2)
- Whale + catalyst + earnings on same ticker = convergent signal
- Historical pattern research support for Gate 3 (when data accumulates)
- Consensus voter in Gate 5 (fundamental perspective)

### RAZIEL (CAO) — GATE 6 PRIMARY OWNER
- Counter-thesis scoring: 0-100. Score >70 = TRADE KILLED.
- Different from Gate 7.5 (which requires counter-thesis to exist). Gate 6 measures STRENGTH.
- The Cascade's immune system. If RAZIEL can't kill a trade, it deserves to live.
- Consensus voter in Gate 5 (adversarial perspective — should be lowest score)

### SERAPH (QA) — CASCADE COMPLIANCE AUDIT
- Monitors that all 8 gates actually run (no skipping)
- Verifies agent consensus scores are internally consistent
- Detects zombie data passing through Gate 1
- Tracks trade log compliance
- Updated version registry to v10.6 across all agents

### GABRIEL (n8n) — CASCADE CODE EXECUTION
- Executes gate code in n8n pipeline (Gates 2, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- P0 BLOCKER: Must fix zombie bug first (10 nodes, per ZOMBIE_BUG_FIX_v2.1.0.md)
- Wiring sequence: Gate 2 → Gate 5 → Gate 6 → Gate 8
- All gates logged for SERAPH audit

## THE PATH TO 100% BULLSEYE INCORPORATION

### PHASE 1: FIX THE FOUNDATION (This Week)
1. ☐ Fix zombie bug — 10 nodes per ZOMBIE_BUG_FIX_v2.1.0.md
2. ☐ Log first trade using trade_log.json
3. ☐ Wire Gate 2 into n8n (after zombie fix)
4. ☐ Wire Gate 5 after Collective Merge
5. ☐ Wire Gate 6 after Gate 5
6. ☐ Wire Gate 8 as final gate

### PHASE 2: FUNDING + INFRASTRUCTURE (Week 2-3)
7. ☐ Register SAM.gov (UEI number)
8. ☐ Apply Virginia SBIG (March 2 deadline)
9. ☐ Apply cloud credit programs (Google/AWS/Microsoft/NVIDIA)
10. ☐ Build market-intel-mcp (Ring 3 — HIGHEST priority MCP)
11. ☐ Build trade-ops-mcp (Ring 4 — feedback loop)

### PHASE 3: DATA ACCUMULATION (Week 3-6)
12. ☐ Log 50+ trades with full Cascade metadata
13. ☐ Bootstrap Gate 3 with academic win rates
14. ☐ Formalize Gate 4 as code node (not just URIEL declaration)
15. ☐ Connect Gate 7 data flow (H35 → Cascade)
16. ☐ Track R&D hours for Section 41 tax credit

### PHASE 4: PLATFORM + CONTENT (Week 4-10)
