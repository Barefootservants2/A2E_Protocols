## SESSION SUMMARY

### Primary Work Product
- **FORGE Competitive Intelligence Report** — Comprehensive analysis of 14+ published prompt engineering frameworks, 6+ books, 7+ tools, and social media techniques. Confirmed CREATE naming collision with Dave Birss (2023). Recommended ANVIL+ASSAY rebrand. Mapped all competitive differentiators. Designed test harness for 50% response improvement validation.

### Key Decisions Made
1. **CREATE must be renamed** — Dave Birss published first (2023), cited by Georgia Tech, UMich, UDC. Same acronym, different words = brand confusion, SEO competition, credibility risk.
2. **Proposed names: ANVIL (input) + ASSAY (output)** — stays in FORGE metallurgy brand family, unique in the space, defensible.
3. **FORGE's killer feature is reverse prompt building** — no competitor has it. This is the development priority.
4. **Test harness design** — 50 prompts, 5 difficulty tiers, paired comparison methodology.
5. **Memory updated** — FORGE rebrand status stored in Claude memory.
