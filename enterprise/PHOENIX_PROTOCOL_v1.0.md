## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PHOENIX is a model-agnostic session persistence layer that solves the universal AI productivity killer: **context loss on session timeout/crash.**

Every AI platform user loses 15-60 minutes daily rebuilding context after sessions die. PHOENIX captures state, stores it, and enables instant recovery across ANY AI model.

**Market:** Every Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and enterprise AI user  
**Pain Point:** $50-200/hour knowledge workers losing 30+ min/day to context rebuild  
**Solution:** Automated checkpoint → storage → recovery pipeline

## THE PROBLEM

### Current State (Broken)

```
USER WORKING WITH AI
        ↓
   [45 minutes of context building]
        ↓
   SESSION TIMEOUT / CRASH / FREEZE
        ↓
   💀 ALL CONTEXT LOST 💀
        ↓
   [15-30 min rebuilding in new session]
        ↓
   REPEAT DAILY
```

### Impact Quantification

| User Type | Sessions/Day | Crashes/Day | Rebuild Time | Daily Loss |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Casual | 2-3 | 0.5 | 10 min | 5 min |
| Power User | 5-10 | 2 | 20 min | 40 min |
| Enterprise | 10-20 | 4 | 30 min | 2 hours |
| AI Developer | 20+ | 5+ | 45 min | 3+ hours |

**Annual productivity loss per power user:** ~170 hours = $8,500-17,000 at $50-100/hr
