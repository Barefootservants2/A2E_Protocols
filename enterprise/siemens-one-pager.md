## THE PROBLEM

**70% of manufacturing AI projects fail beyond pilot.** (McKinsey 2025)

**Why?** Current AI orchestration systems have no mandatory verification layer. They generate output without challenging assumptions, verifying sources, or producing counter-arguments.

- AI generates → Output ships → Hope it's right
- No premise challenge → Garbage in, garbage out
- No counter-thesis → Blind spots remain hidden
- No authority scoring → All sources treated equally

**Result:** 3-17% hallucination rates even in best systems. Unacceptable for manufacturing.

## THE SOLUTION

**URIEL COVENANT: Universal Verification Orchestration Protocol**

| Current AI | Uriel Covenant |
|------------|----------------|
| AI generates output | AI generates claims |
| Output ships on completion | Claims pass 18 mandatory gates |
| Single-model dependency | Multi-model consensus |
| Hope it's right | **Verify it's right** |

**Core Innovation:**
- **18 Mandatory Verification Gates** — No ship if any gate fails
- **Counter-Thesis Generation** — Minimum 3 failure modes per analysis
- **Authority Scoring** — Quantified source quality (AS ≥ 2.0)
- **Human Principal Hierarchy** — Structured authority preservation
- **KILLSWITCH** — Hard stop on threshold breach
