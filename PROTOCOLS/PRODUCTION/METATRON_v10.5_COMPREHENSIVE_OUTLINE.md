# 1. VERSION CONTEXT

## 1.1 What Triggered This Realignment

On February 11, 2026, a P1 audit discovered that the HUNTER wiring documentation (v10.4) contained **fabricated data** — the H1 SEC EDGAR node configuration was rewritten with different API endpoints and parameters than what existed in the live n8n workflow. This violated the FIDELITY LOCK protocol's VERBATIM requirement and exposed a systemic failure: documentation fidelity protocols rely on qualitative self-enforcement by generative AI models, and that mechanism fails under context dilution.

## 1.2 The 5-Day Realignment Timeline

| Date | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| Feb 11 | Documentation fabrication discovered in HUNTER wiring | P1 declared, all work halted |
| Feb 12 | ANCHOR/anti-drift mechanism proposed | Competitive analysis built (16 unique capabilities found) |
| Feb 12 | Intelligence Source Expansion designed | ORACLE v3.0, SENTINEL, CHRONICLE protocols proposed |
| Feb 13 | AIORA UNIFIED v1.0 workflow merge | 65-node n8n workflow rebuilt, API key audit completed |
| Feb 14 | Full system audit → P1 Collective Review | 4/4 unanimous concurrence on 19 structural fixes |
| Feb 14 | 22 proposed enhancements from 4 agents | Consolidated into 5 implementation tiers |
| Feb 15 AM | METATRON v10.4 draft built | 858 → 1,188 lines, TIER 1+2 fixes implemented |
| Feb 15 AM | GABRIEL v1 Verification Workflow seed file | Automated verification workflow for n8n |
| Feb 15 PM | SENTINEL Stack v1.0 designed | 3-layer social intelligence + gamma detection |
| Feb 15 PM | This document | v10.5 comprehensive outline for Collective review |

## 1.3 Version Numbering Decision

| Component | Previous | New | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----|-----------|
| METATRON | v10.3 (production) / v10.4 (draft) | **v10.5** | v10.4 structural fixes + SENTINEL integration = new version |
| HUNTER | v3.0 (discovery methodology) | **v3.0** (RETAINED, expanded) | Discovery methodology unchanged; module set expanded |
| HUNTER Wiring | v10.4 | **v10.5** | Aligned to METATRON version, SENTINEL nodes added |
| SENTINEL | NEW | **v1.0** | New subsystem, first release |
| FIDELITY LOCK | v10.3 | **v10.5** | 5 locks → 7 locks + Mode Declaration gate |
| PHOENIX | v10.2 | **v10.5** | Atomic Sessions + ANCHOR trigger added |
| VERSION CHANGELOG | Last updated at v10.2 | **Updated to v10.5** | 3 version entries behind |

---

## PART 3: GATE ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 Gate Categories
- **HARD HALT:** Must pass or analysis terminates
- **DATA REQUIRED:** Must have data or field marked [NULL]
- **CONTEXTUAL:** Inform but don't halt

### 3.2 Enforcement Rules
- Hard Halt gates have NO override
- Data Required gates enforce SEARCH FIRST
- Contextual gates document gaps but proceed

### 3.3 TIER 1: HARD HALT GATES

#### GATE 0: SELF-VERIFICATION
- Agent confirms identity, protocol version, session state
- Runs automatically on every new session

#### GATE 0.5: PREMISE CHALLENGE
- Challenge the question before answering it
- "Are we asking the right question?"

#### GATE 0.75: EXECUTION FIDELITY LOCK ⚡ ENHANCED v10.5
**7 Locks (expanded from 5 in v10.3):**

| Lock | Name | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | VERBATIM | All source material unchanged |
| 2 | SINGLE PASS | No redundant restatement |
| 3 | SEARCH FIRST | Verify before claiming unavailable |
| 4 | PERMISSION | All modifications explicitly requested |
| 5 | INSTRUCTION PRIORITY | Execute as stated, not interpreted |
| 6 | EVIDENCE + NULL ⚡ NEW | Missing data = [NULL], never fabrication |
| 7 | ATTESTATION BLOCK ⚡ NEW | Auditable field verification at output |

**Lock 5 Clarification (v10.4):**
- PROHIBITED: Reframing that changes intent
- PERMITTED: Reframing that improves the answer
- 4-step ANVIL prompt engine loop: identify gap → present protocol → ask actual goal → Q&A until 100%
- Standard: "Every ask is treated as if our reputation depends on it — because it does."

**Lock 6 — Evidence + NULL Standard (v10.4):**
- When evidence unavailable: correct response = `[NULL]` or `[NO DATA]`
- In STRICT mode: every field = evidence with source OR `[NULL — reason]`
- In CREATIVE mode: analytical gaps acknowledged, factual claims still sourced
- Returning [NULL] is CORRECT behavior. Fabricating = GATE 14 violation.

**Lock 7 — Attestation Block (v10.4):**
```
## ATTESTATION
VERIFIED: [X] fields — evidence attached
UNVERIFIED: [Y] fields — marked [NULL] with reason
GENERATED WITHOUT EVIDENCE: 0 — REQUIRED
MODE: STRICT/ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT: [Agent name]
TIMESTAMP: [ISO 8601]
```
- `GENERATED WITHOUT EVIDENCE: 0` is REQUIRED. Nonzero = self-reported Gate 14 violation.

**Gate 0.75 Checklist (Run on EVERY output):**
```
□ VERBATIM: All source material unchanged?
□ SINGLE PASS: No redundant restatement?
□ SEARCH FIRST: Verified before claiming unavailable?
□ PERMISSION: All modifications explicitly requested?
□ INSTRUCTION: Executing as stated, not interpreted?
□ EVIDENCE+NULL: Every factual field has evidence OR marked [NULL]?
□ ATTESTATION: Field verification counts included (STRICT mode)?
ALL SEVEN = PASS → Proceed
ANY FAIL = HALT → Correct before output
```

#### GATE 0.8: MODE DECLARATION ⚡ NEW v10.4
- Every output begins with explicit mode declaration header
- **Modes:** STRICT (documentation, wiring, configuration), CREATIVE (analysis, strategy), STRATEGIC (recommendations), ADMINISTRATIVE (session management)
- Mode determines which locks are mandatory vs. recommended
- Mode mismatch = HALT and correct

#### GATE 1: PRINCIPAL AUTHORITY CHECK
- Does this output align with Principal's directive?
- Any ambiguity = clarify, don't assume

#### GATE 2: CONTRADICTION DETECTOR
- Does this output contradict previously verified information?
- Cross-reference against existing protocol documents

#### GATE 3: DATA EXISTENCE CHECK
- NO DATA = NO PROCEED (Hard halt)
- Cannot make claims without evidence

#### GATE 7.5: COUNTER-THESIS REQUIREMENT
- Every thesis requires a counter-thesis
- 3 failure modes minimum: Market Risk, Company Risk, Thesis Risk
- No analysis is complete without adversarial review

#### GATE 14: FABRICATION CHECK
- Zero tolerance for fabricated data
- Self-reported via Attestation Block (Lock 7)
- Violation = immediate correction + audit trail entry

# 8. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR COLLECTIVE

## 8.1 Architecture Questions

1. **HUNTER Wiring Document Consolidation:** We currently have HUNTER_WIRING_DIAGRAM_v10.4.md (1110 lines) AND HUNTER_WIRING_DOCUMENT_v2.0.md (1704 lines). Should v10.5 consolidate these into a single wiring document, or maintain both?

2. **SENTINEL as Separate Workflow:** Should SENTINEL run as a separate n8n workflow (independent polling, independent alerts) or be integrated into the existing HUNTER-DAILY workflow? Recommendation: SEPARATE — different polling intervals, different alert paths, independent failure isolation.

3. **Databento OPRA Path:** The $125 free credit POC is zero risk. Should the Collective formally evaluate the methodology (ACF analysis, wash trade detection) as a potential PhD research track?

## 8.2 Version Numbering Questions

4. **Agent Instruction Versions:** Should agent instructions jump directly to v10.5, or should v10.4 be pushed first as an intermediate step? Recommendation: DIRECT to v10.5 — v10.4 was a draft that never went to production.

5. **HUNTER Version:** The HUNTER system is currently documented as v3.0 (discovery methodology). With SENTINEL adding 11 new nodes, does this warrant a version bump to v3.5 or v4.0? Recommendation: RETAIN v3.0 — the methodology is unchanged, only the module set expanded.

## 8.3 Prioritization Questions

6. **Build Order:** Given the Principal's bandwidth (Naples relocation, PhD prep), what's the realistic build sequence? Recommended: SENTINEL L1 first (highest ROI, closes biggest gap), then L2, then L3, then convergence engine.

7. **GABRIEL v1 Verification Workflow:** The seed file is delivered. When should this be prioritized relative to SENTINEL? These address different problems (documentation integrity vs. market intelligence).

## 8.4 Pending Specifications Needed

8. **CHRONICLE Protocol** (YouTube Transcript Pipeline) — Needs full specification
9. **Ground News Integration** — Needs specification and API evaluation
10. **Golden-Set Test Repository** — Needs specification for regression testing
11. **Decay Prediction Model** — Needs specification (how to predict when protocols will drift)
12. **Cross-Agent Audit Protocol** — Needs specification
