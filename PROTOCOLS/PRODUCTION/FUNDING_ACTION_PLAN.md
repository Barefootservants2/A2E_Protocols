## PART 1: SAM.gov REGISTRATION (DO THIS WEEK)

- You need:

  - If no EIN yet: Apply at https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online (instant, free)
  - DUNS number is no longer required — UEI replaced it

**Step 2: Complete Entity Registration**

## PART 3: TAX STRATEGY (Discuss with CPA)

### Section 174 — R&D Expenses (Mandatory Capitalization)
Since 2022, R&D expenses must be CAPITALIZED and amortized over 5 years (domestic) or 15 years (foreign). This means you can't deduct them all in Year 1 — but they ARE deductible over time.

What qualifies:
- All software development costs (your n8n workflows, code, protocols)
- API subscriptions used for R&D
- Cloud compute for model training
- Your time spent developing (at reasonable hourly rate)
- Testing and experimentation costs

### Section 41 — R&D Tax Credit (THE BIG ONE)
Small businesses can claim up to **$250,000/year** against payroll taxes.

**Qualification test (all 4 must be met):**
1. ✅ Technological in nature — AI/ML development
2. ✅ Elimination of uncertainty — you don't know if the approach will work
3. ✅ Process of experimentation — you test, iterate, modify
4. ✅ Qualified purpose — developing new or improved functionality

**A2E qualifies on ALL FOUR.** Multi-agent orchestration, confidence cascade algorithms, ML feedback loops — all are novel development with uncertain outcomes.

**Documentation required:**
- ✅ GitHub commit history (timestamps, descriptions, changes)
- ✅ Protocol version changelogs
- ✅ Test harness results (213 tests documented)
- ✅ Session transcripts (PHOENIX carry-forward documents)
- ❓ Time tracking — START tracking hours spent on R&D

**Action:** Talk to your CPA about Form 6765 (Credit for Increasing Research Activities).

### Section 179 / Bonus Depreciation — Equipment
- Computer hardware: full deduction in year purchased
- Software purchases: full deduction
- Home office equipment used for A2E: deductible

### Section 280A — Home Office
If you use a dedicated space for A2E:
- Simplified method: $5/sq ft, up to 300 sq ft = $1,500
- Regular method: percentage of home costs (mortgage/rent, utilities, internet)

### Ordinary Business Expenses
- n8n Cloud subscription
- LLM API costs (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, DeepSeek, Perplexity)
- GitHub subscription
- Internet service (business percentage)
- Phone (business percentage)
- Professional development (PhD tuition if business-related)
- Conference attendance
- Domain registration / hosting
- Telegram / communication tools

### NeedyMeds — Transplant Medications
From your memory: needymeds.org for transplant medication assistance. This is SEPARATE from business deductions but reduces personal costs, freeing capital for A2E.
