# HUNTER 11-SECTOR GICS SCAN v4.0
## METATRON v10.3 | MANDATORY SESSION PROTOCOL
## Effective: February 17, 2026
## Classification: PRODUCTION — ENFORCED EVERY SESSION
## Authority: Principal Directive — William Earl Lemon

---

## SUPERSEDES
- 8_SECTOR_BLIND_SCAN_PROTOCOL_v1.0.md (archived)
- Expands from 8 market segments to full 11 GICS sectors + 3 macro overlays

---

## CORE RULE — NON-NEGOTIABLE

> **Every MICHA session that discusses market positions, trading, or portfolio management
> MUST include a full 11-sector scan BEFORE any position-specific analysis.**
>
> **Violation = protocol breach. No exceptions. No shortcuts.**

**Origin:** Feb 9, 2026 — Identified HUNTER operating at 15-20% capacity by tunnel-visioning on existing holdings.
**Escalation:** Feb 17, 2026 — Principal directive after repeated sector scan omissions. Upgraded from 8-sector to 11 GICS + macro overlays with enforcement checkpoints.

---

## WHY THIS EXISTS

10-15% annual return on $300K+ = $30K-$45K. That money is LOST when we:
- Miss sector rotations because we only watch what we own
- Enter positions without understanding relative sector strength
- Ignore diversification because we're fixated on thesis confirmation
- Deploy capital into weakening sectors while stronger sectors go unmonitored

**HUNTER = market-wide, NEVER thesis-specific. Wide net. Data leads, Principal decides.**

## EXECUTION ORDER

### PHASE 1: MACRO OVERLAYS (Run First — Sets Context for Everything)

#### OVERLAY A: RATES & BONDS

- Fed funds rate expectations (CME FedWatch)
- Next FOMC date + market pricing for action
- **Impact Map:** Which sectors benefit/suffer from current rate trajectory?

#### OVERLAY B: CURRENCIES
- DXY (Dollar Index) — single strongest driver for metals and international earnings
- EUR/USD, USD/JPY for risk appetite
- Emerging market currencies (stress indicator for global growth)

#### OVERLAY C: GEOPOLITICAL & POLICY

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

### Session Checkpoint
At session initialization, MICHA must verify:
- [ ] Sector scan completed in current session OR within last 24 hours
- [ ] If not completed, run BEFORE any position analysis
- [ ] Scan results documented in AIORA/reports/hunter_daily/

### Drift Detection
If 3 consecutive sessions pass without a sector scan:
- **MICHA must flag this as a protocol violation**
- **Principal must be informed explicitly**
- **No position-level analysis until scan is completed**

### Documentation
Every sector scan must be:
1. Summarized in session chat
2. Filed to AIORA/reports/hunter_daily/sector_scan_[DATE].md
3. Archived with portfolio allocation implications noted
