# SILVER PATTERN PROTOCOL v1.0

**Version:** 1.0 | **Effective:** February 10, 2026
**Classification:** AIORA GATE SUPPLEMENT — Thesis Validation
**Authority:** Principal Directive

---

## PURPOSE

Distinguish TEMPORARY corrections from TERMINAL crashes in silver positions. This protocol was developed from the Jan 30, 2026 silver crash ($122 → $78, -36%) and subsequent recovery, combined with historical pattern analysis.

---

## THE TWO PATTERNS

### PATTERN A: TEMPORARY CORRECTION (Shakeout)
**Characteristics:**
- Paper price crashes while physical demand SURGES
- Shanghai premium WIDENS (physical buyers stepping in)
- COMEX registered inventory DRAINS (metal leaving vaults)
- CME raises margins (forced deleveraging of leveraged longs)
- Recovery begins within 3-10 trading days
- Volume spikes on the crash day, then normalizes

**Historical examples:**
- Jan 30, 2026: $122 → $78 (-36%), recovered to $83 within 10 days
- Silver flash crashes of 2011, 2013, 2020 followed similar patterns

**Action:** HOLD or ADD on confirmed bounce. Widen stops to 15%+.

### PATTERN B: TERMINAL CRASH (Thesis Broken)
**Characteristics:**
- Paper price crashes AND physical demand COLLAPSES
- Shanghai premium NARROWS or goes NEGATIVE (no physical bid)
- COMEX registered inventory BUILDS (metal returning to vaults)
- Central banks SELLING gold reserves (macro risk-off)
- No recovery after 15+ trading days
- Volume remains elevated on continued selling

**Action:** EXIT. Thesis is dead. Preserve capital.
