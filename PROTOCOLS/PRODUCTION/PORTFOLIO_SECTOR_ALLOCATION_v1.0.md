# PORTFOLIO SECTOR ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK v1.0
## METATRON v10.3 | IRONCLAD COMPLIANT
## Effective: February 17, 2026
## Authority: Principal Directive — William Earl Lemon

## PURPOSE

Define target sector allocation across ALL accounts to ensure:
1. Diversification across multiple GICS sectors
2. No single-sector concentration exceeding risk limits
3. Every deployed dollar maps to a thesis supported by sector scan data
4. Returns of 10-15% annualized are achievable through disciplined allocation
