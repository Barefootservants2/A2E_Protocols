# IRONCLAD QUICK REFERENCE CARD
## Tape to Monitor. No Exceptions.

---

### BEFORE EVERY TRADE
```
□ Gate 10.5: Position size = $802 ÷ Stop Distance = ___ shares
□ Gate 10.5: Position value ≤ $10,694 (20% cap)
□ Gate 12.5: Any binary events in next 7 days? → Reduce
□ Gate 13.5: Sector total ≤ 35% ($18,715)
□ Gate 11.5: Set trim ladder orders IMMEDIATELY
```

### TRIM LADDER (Set at Entry, Execute Without Thinking)
```
STOP:    -5%  → Sell ALL. You were wrong. Move on.
TIER 1: +10%  → Sell 50%. Move stop to breakeven.
TIER 2: +20%  → Sell 60% of remaining. Trail stop to +10%.
RUNNER: +25%+ → Hold 20% of original. 10% trailing stop.
```

### DAILY RULES
```
Position up +5% intraday  → Trim 25% minimum
Position down 3 days straight → Cut 50% on Day 3
Position gaps down >3% → NO adding for 24 hours
Stop triggers → NO re-entry for 48 hours
```

### WEEKLY (Every Friday Close)
```
□ Sector concentration check
□ All stops verified
□ All trim orders in place
□ Binary event scan for next week
□ Portfolio rebalance if needed
```

### THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS
```
Max loss per trade: $802
Max loss per day:   $2,139
```
If you're risking more than this, you're off-plan.

### WHEN YOU WANT TO BREAK THE RULES, READ THIS:

$4,500 loss — overconcentrated, no stops.
$3,042 loss — overconcentrated, skipped trims.

Both times the thesis was RIGHT.
Both times the position management was WRONG.
The thesis doesn't make you money. The EXITS make you money.

Follow. The. Plan.
