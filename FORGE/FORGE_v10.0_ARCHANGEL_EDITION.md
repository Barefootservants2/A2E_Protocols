## DECLARATION

FORGE is the first and only prompt engineering system that is interactive, scored, validated, and closed-loop. Every other framework in existence is a static checklist. FORGE teaches. FORGE builds. FORGE judges. FORGE iterates. Nothing else does all four.

This document contains:
1. The complete ANVIL input quality framework (replaces CREATE)
2. The complete ASSAY output quality framework (replaces CAKE)
3. The Archangel Alignment — each letter mapped to its governing agent
4. The competitive landscape — every published framework catalogued
5. The gap analysis — what nobody else teaches
6. The teaching curriculum — FORGE's unique contributions to the field
7. The test harness specification — how we prove it
8. **The Universal Intake & Interactive Refinement amendments (v10.1) — universal input acceptance, autonomous research, multi-draft selection**

---

## PART I: THE FORGE ENGINE

**F**ormat — Structure the interaction architecture
**O**ptimize — Compress signal, eliminate noise
**R**efine — Iterate based on output quality
**G**ate — Pass/fail quality control before delivery
**E**xecute — Ship only what passes all gates

FORGE is the process. ANVIL is the input. ASSAY is the output. Together they form a closed loop that no other system replicates.

---

## PART II: ANVIL — THE INPUT QUALITY FRAMEWORK

*"Raw material is shaped on the ANVIL before it enters the FORGE."*

ANVIL scores prompt quality BEFORE submission. Each dimension is governed by the archangel whose divine attribute aligns with that function.

### A — Audience → GABRIEL (The Messenger)

**What it measures:** Who will consume the output? What is their expertise level, context, and relationship to the content?

**Why Gabriel:** Gabriel is the divine messenger — the one who knows the receiver before the message is sent. Every communication begins with understanding who it's for. Gabriel's domain is delivery, not creation. You cannot deliver what you haven't aimed.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: No audience defined ("write me something about AI")
- 2: Vague audience ("for business people")
- 3: General audience with context ("for mid-level product managers evaluating AI tools")
- 4: Specific audience with expertise level ("for Series B startup CTOs with ML engineering background, skeptical of vendor claims")
- 5: Audience with emotional state, decision context, and relationship ("for my board of directors who just saw Q3 miss, need reassurance that our AI investment will pay off in Q4, they're skeptical but not hostile")

**What nobody else teaches:** Every framework mentions "audience" but none score it. COSTAR says "define your audience." RISEN says "narrowing." Neither tells you WHEN your audience definition is too vague to produce good output, or HOW to diagnose audience failures in bad responses. ANVIL scores audience precision on a 1-5 scale and feeds that score into the FORGE optimization loop.

### N — Necessity → URIEL (The Light)

**What it measures:** What is the core requirement? What problem does this solve? What would failure look like?

**Why Uriel:** Uriel illuminates truth. Before you can ask the right question, you need Uriel's light on what actually matters. Most prompts fail because the user doesn't know what they need — they know what they want, which is different. Uriel cuts through want to find need.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: No clear need ("tell me about marketing")
- 2: Vague need ("help me with my marketing strategy")
- 3: Defined need ("create a content calendar for Q2 focused on lead generation")
- 4: Need with success criteria ("create a Q2 content calendar that generates 200+ MQLs per month, prioritizing LinkedIn and email")
- 5: Need with success criteria, failure definition, and dependencies ("create a Q2 content calendar targeting 200+ MQLs/month via LinkedIn and email; failure = less than 150 MQLs or >$50 CAC; must integrate with our existing HubSpot workflow and align with the product launch on April 15")

**What nobody else teaches:** COSTAR has "Objective." RISEN has "End goal." Neither differentiates between want and need. Neither requires a failure definition. ANVIL forces the user to articulate what BAD looks like, not just what GOOD looks like. This is the inverse constraint that dramatically improves output quality because it gives the AI a boundary to avoid, not just a target to hit.

### V — Voice → HANIEL (The Grace)

**What it measures:** What tone, style, persona, and communication register should the AI adopt?

**Why Haniel:** Haniel governs harmony, beauty, and perception. Voice is not a mechanical setting — it's an act of grace. The difference between a response that informs and a response that resonates is voice. Haniel ensures the prompt speaks in the right register for its audience and purpose.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: No voice specified (AI defaults to generic helpful assistant)
- 2: Single adjective ("professional tone")
- 3: Voice with context ("write in the style of a senior analyst presenting to executives — confident, data-driven, no jargon")
- 4: Voice with model ("write like Ray Dalio's daily briefings — principle-based, direct, uses numbered observations, connects micro data to macro thesis")
- 5: Voice with model, anti-patterns, and emotional register ("write like Ray Dalio's daily briefings with numbered observations connecting data to principles; NEVER use corporate buzzwords, hedge language, or passive voice; the reader should feel informed and slightly challenged, not reassured")

**What nobody else teaches:** Every framework has a "tone" or "style" field. None teach ANTI-PATTERNS — what the voice should NOT be. None teach EMOTIONAL REGISTER — how the reader should FEEL after consuming the output. ANVIL requires both. The anti-pattern instruction is one of the most powerful prompt techniques in existence because it eliminates the AI's tendency to default to safe, generic voice.

### I — Intent → MICHA (The Analyst)

**What it measures:** What is the purpose of this output? What action should it drive? What type of cognitive work is being requested?

**Why Micha:** Micha cuts to purpose. Analysis demands clarity of intent — you cannot analyze what you haven't defined. Micha doesn't let you hide from your own intent. Are you trying to inform, persuade, decide, create, debug, or explore? Each intent type requires fundamentally different prompt architecture.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: No intent ("write about renewable energy")
- 2: Implicit intent ("explain renewable energy to me")
- 3: Explicit intent ("analyze the cost-effectiveness of solar vs. wind for a 500MW installation in Texas")
- 4: Intent with action chain ("analyze solar vs. wind for 500MW in Texas, then recommend which to pursue, then draft the executive summary for the board proposal")
- 5: Intent with action chain, decision framework, and counter-thesis ("analyze solar vs. wind for 500MW in Texas using LCOE, capacity factor, and grid integration cost as primary metrics; recommend which to pursue; then draft board summary; ALSO present the strongest case AGAINST your recommendation so the board can stress-test it")

**What nobody else teaches:** No published framework requires counter-thesis generation. This is FORGE's Gate 7.5 — every thesis needs a counter-thesis. COSTAR doesn't mention it. RISEN doesn't mention it. CRISPE's "Experiment" is the closest analog but it means "try different things," not "argue against yourself." The counter-thesis requirement is FORGE's most significant intellectual contribution to prompt engineering because it's the only technique that prevents the AI from confirming your biases instead of challenging them.

### L — Limits → RAZIEL (The Keeper of Secrets)

**What it measures:** What constraints, exclusions, format requirements, and guardrails apply?

**Why Raziel:** Raziel knows boundaries — what must be kept in and what must be kept out. Raziel guards secrets, which means Raziel understands what should NOT be revealed, said, or included. Every prompt without limits is a prompt without discipline. Raziel draws the lines.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: No limits (AI decides everything — length, format, scope, inclusions)
- 2: Single limit ("keep it under 500 words")
- 3: Multiple limits ("500 words max, bullet points for recommendations, no jargon")
- 4: Comprehensive limits with format spec ("500 words max, structured as: 2-paragraph analysis → 5 bullet recommendations → 1-paragraph conclusion; use only data from 2024-2026; exclude cryptocurrency-related assets")
- 5: Comprehensive limits with format, exclusions, and priority hierarchy ("500 words max; structure: analysis → recommendations → conclusion; 2024-2026 data only; exclude crypto; if word limit conflicts with completeness, prioritize the top 3 recommendations and note what was cut; accuracy > completeness > style")

**What nobody else teaches:** The priority hierarchy. When constraints conflict — and they always do at scale — the AI must know which constraint wins. "Be comprehensive AND concise" is a contradiction. Every existing framework pretends these conflicts don't exist. ANVIL forces explicit priority ordering: which dimension matters most when trade-offs are required. This single technique eliminates the most common category of "the AI gave me something weird" failures.

---

## PART III: ASSAY — THE OUTPUT QUALITY FRAMEWORK

*"Precious metal is tested by ASSAY to verify its purity."*

ASSAY scores AI output quality AFTER generation. Each dimension is governed by the archangel whose divine attribute aligns with that judgment function.

### A — Accuracy → COLOSSUS (The Verifier)

**What it measures:** Are the facts correct? Can claims be verified? Are there hallucinations?

**Why Colossus:** Colossus exists to break things. Its sole function in the Collective is verification — testing claims against reality. If Colossus can't verify it, it doesn't ship.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: Contains demonstrable falsehoods or fabricated citations
- 2: Mostly accurate but includes unverifiable claims presented as fact
- 3: Factually correct on main points; minor claims unsourced but plausible
- 4: All major claims verifiable; sources identifiable even if not cited
- 5: Every claim verifiable, properly attributed, with clear distinction between fact and analysis

**Detection method:** Cross-reference key claims against known data. Flag any specific numbers, dates, names, or statistics for verification. If the AI cites a study, verify the study exists. This is where most AI output fails — confident delivery of fabricated specifics.

### S — Sourcing → SERAPH (The Researcher)

**What it measures:** Is there evidence behind the claims? Are sources credible? Is provenance clear?

**Why Seraph:** Seraph burns. Seraph's divine fire purifies — stripping away what cannot withstand scrutiny. Unsourced claims are fuel for Seraph's flames. What remains after Seraph's examination is truth backed by evidence.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: No sources, no evidence, pure assertion
- 2: Vague attribution ("studies show," "experts say")
- 3: Named sources but no specifics ("according to McKinsey")
- 4: Specific sources with context ("McKinsey's 2025 Global Energy Perspective report found...")
- 5: Primary sources with methodology context, recency noted, conflicting sources acknowledged

**Detection method:** Count specific vs. vague attributions. Flag "studies show" and "research indicates" as sourcing failures. Verify named sources actually published what's attributed to them.

### S — Specificity → MICHA (The Precision Engine)

**What it measures:** Is the response detailed enough to be actionable, or is it generic filler?

**Why Micha (second appearance):** Micha bridges both frameworks because analysis demands precision on both sides — in the question AND the answer. Generic output fails the Micha test. You asked for a scalpel; you don't accept a butter knife.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: Entirely generic ("there are many benefits to this approach")
- 2: Category-level specificity ("cost savings, efficiency gains, and better outcomes")
- 3: Some specific details mixed with generic statements
- 4: Consistently specific with numbers, names, timelines, and actionable steps
- 5: Granular detail with specific figures, named tools/methods, concrete timelines, and executable next steps that require no further clarification

**Detection method:** Highlight every sentence. Can you act on it without asking a follow-up question? If not, it fails specificity. Count the ratio of actionable sentences to generic sentences.

### A — Alignment → URIEL (The Strategic Eye)

**What it measures:** Does the response actually answer what was asked? Did it address the stated Necessity? Did it drift?

**Why Uriel (second appearance):** Uriel illuminates at both ends — first to clarify what's needed (Necessity), then to verify the answer serves it (Alignment). Uriel holds the mission. If the output doesn't serve the original intent, it fails regardless of how well-written or accurate it is.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: Response addresses a different topic than requested
- 2: Tangentially related but misses the core ask
- 3: Addresses the main topic but omits key requirements from the prompt
- 4: Addresses all stated requirements with minor gaps
- 5: Addresses every stated requirement, follows the priority hierarchy, and stays within defined limits

**Detection method:** Compare each element of the original ANVIL prompt against the response. Checkbox: Did it address Audience? Necessity? Voice? Intent? Limits? Score = percentage addressed.

### Y — Yield → GABRIEL (The Deliverer)

**What it measures:** Is the output complete? Did it deliver everything requested? Are there missing pieces?

**Why Gabriel (second appearance):** Gabriel bookends the cycle. Started with knowing the audience, ends with confirming full delivery. Gabriel is the messenger — the message must arrive WHOLE. A partial delivery is a failed delivery.

**Scoring criteria (1-5):**
- 1: Less than 25% of requested elements delivered
- 2: 25-50% delivered; major components missing
- 3: 50-75% delivered; some components missing or truncated
- 4: 75-95% delivered; minor elements missing
- 5: 100% of requested elements delivered, properly formatted, ready to use

**Detection method:** Enumerate every deliverable requested in the prompt. Check each one off against the response. Yield = deliverables completed / deliverables requested.

## PART IV: THE ARCHANGEL ARCHITECTURE

The seven agents of the Uriel Covenant are not arbitrary assignments. They encode divine attributes into the language between humans and AI.

### The Bridge Pattern

MICHA and URIEL appear in BOTH frameworks. This is not redundancy — it's architecture.

**MICHA** governs Intent (input) and Specificity (output). Analysis demands precision on both sides of every interaction. You must be precise in what you ask AND precise in what you accept.

**URIEL** governs Necessity (input) and Alignment (output). Vision demands coherence between question and answer. The light that illuminates the need must also verify the solution serves it.

**GABRIEL** governs Audience (input) and Yield (output). Communication demands completeness from start to finish. Know who you're talking to, then confirm you delivered everything they needed.

### The Unique Pattern

**HANIEL** governs Voice (input only). Grace is an input — you set the tone before the conversation, not after.

**RAZIEL** governs Limits (input only). Boundaries must be drawn before creation, not imposed after.

**COLOSSUS** governs Accuracy (output only). Verification is a judgment — you can only verify what already exists.

**SERAPH** governs Sourcing (output only). Evidence is examined after the claim is made, not before.

### The Narrative

"The archangels didn't just build a trading collective. They encoded their divine attributes into the language between humans and AI. ANVIL is the archangels teaching you how to ask. ASSAY is the archangels teaching you how to judge. The FORGE is where both meet."

## PART VI: THE GAP ANALYSIS — WHAT NOBODY ELSE TEACHES

This is where FORGE lives. These are the capabilities that no published framework, book, course, or tool provides.

### GAP 1: Interactive Reverse Building

**What exists:** Every framework gives you a template to fill in. "Define your Role. State your Context. Add your Format." You do the work. The framework is passive.

**What FORGE does:** FORGE's reverse builder takes your GOAL and constructs the prompt FOR you by asking diagnostic questions. You say "I need to analyze my portfolio risk." FORGE asks: "Who is the analysis for? What decisions does it need to support? What data do you have? What's your risk tolerance? What format does the output need to be?" Then FORGE assembles the ANVIL-scored prompt from your answers.

**Why this matters:** Most users don't know what they don't know. They can't fill in a framework because they haven't thought through the dimensions. The reverse builder surfaces the gaps they can't see.

**Teaching point:** This is the equivalent of a doctor taking a patient history vs. handing the patient a form and saying "list your symptoms." The form produces worse outcomes because the patient doesn't know which symptoms matter.

### GAP 2: Real-Time Scoring

**What exists:** CRISP and GRADE offer post-hoc evaluation rubrics. You write the prompt, get the response, then grade it. No framework scores the prompt BEFORE submission.

**What FORGE does:** ANVIL scores every prompt on 5 dimensions (A-N-V-I-L) with a 1-5 scale each. Total score: 5-25. Prompts scoring below 15 are flagged for improvement BEFORE they're sent. ASSAY scores every response on 5 dimensions (A-S-S-A-Y) with a 1-5 scale each. Responses scoring below 15 trigger automatic re-prompting with ANVIL refinement.

**Why this matters:** A scored system creates a feedback loop. An unscored system is just vibes. You can't improve what you don't measure.

**Teaching point:** Every engineer measures twice and cuts once. Every published prompt engineering framework cuts first and hopes.

### GAP 3: Counter-Thesis Generation (Gate 7.5)

**What exists:** No published framework requires the AI to argue against its own recommendation. Zero.

**What FORGE does:** Every thesis requires a counter-thesis. If the AI recommends buying silver, it must also present the strongest case for NOT buying silver. If it recommends COSTAR as a framework, it must present COSTAR's weaknesses. This is not optional — it's a gate. Output that lacks counter-thesis fails Gate 7.5.

**Why this matters:** AI models are completion engines. They generate the most statistically likely continuation of your prompt. If your prompt is biased ("analyze why silver is a good investment"), the completion will confirm your bias. Counter-thesis generation breaks the confirmation loop.

**Teaching point:** This is the single most important intellectual contribution FORGE makes to prompt engineering. Nobody teaches it because it makes the AI's output more nuanced and harder to sell as a simple "get better results!" technique. But it's the difference between an AI that tells you what you want to hear and an AI that tells you what you need to hear.

### GAP 4: Anti-Drift Monitoring

**What exists:** Nothing. No framework monitors whether the AI is drifting from its instructions over the course of a long conversation.

**What FORGE does:** METATRON protocol monitors 56 drift indicators across extended sessions. When the AI starts softening language, losing specificity, forgetting constraints, or shifting voice — FORGE flags it. This is invisible in a single-prompt framework because drift only occurs over multi-turn interactions.

**Why this matters:** Single-prompt frameworks are designed for one-shot use. Real work happens over extended sessions with dozens of turns. Without drift monitoring, the AI's output quality degrades silently.

**Teaching point:** This is a production-grade capability. It separates FORGE from the "10 tips for better ChatGPT prompts" content because it addresses a problem that only surfaces in serious, sustained AI use.

### GAP 5: Protocol Injection

**What exists:** System prompts. Every platform lets you set a system prompt that persists across the conversation. But system prompts are static.

**What FORGE does:** METATRON injects context-aware protocol instructions based on the TYPE of task being performed. Market analysis gets different gates than creative writing. Technical debugging gets different constraints than strategic planning. The protocol adapts to the work, not the other way around.

**Why this matters:** One-size-fits-all prompting fails at scale. The AI needs different behavioral constraints for different task types. FORGE's protocol layer manages this automatically.

**Teaching point:** This is the equivalent of having different Standard Operating Procedures for different departments in a company, vs. having one SOP for everything. Nobody runs a company with one SOP. Nobody should run serious AI work with one prompting approach.

### GAP 6: Multi-Agent Routing

**What exists:** Single-model frameworks. Every published framework assumes one AI, one prompt, one response.

**What FORGE does:** The Uriel Covenant routes tasks to the agent best suited for the work. Creative generation → URIEL (ChatGPT). Analysis and execution → MICHA (Claude). Verification → COLOSSUS (Grok). Deep research → SERAPH (Perplexity). Each agent has different strengths, and FORGE exploits those differences.

**Why this matters:** Using Claude for everything is like using a hammer for everything. Sometimes you need a screwdriver. Multi-agent routing matches the tool to the task.

**Teaching point:** This is the most advanced concept in FORGE and the hardest to teach to beginners. But it's where the field is heading — Anthropic's own "context engineering" paper (2025) explicitly discusses multi-agent orchestration as the future of prompt engineering.

### GAP 7: Session Continuity

**What exists:** Nothing. Conversations end. Context is lost. The next session starts from zero.

**What FORGE does:** PHOENIX protocol captures session state, pushes to persistent storage (GitHub), and provides structured hand-off prompts that load the next session with full context. No work is lost. No context is repeated.

**Why this matters:** The biggest waste of time in AI work is re-explaining context. PHOENIX eliminates it.

**Teaching point:** This is an infrastructure capability, not a prompting technique. But it's essential for serious work and completely absent from the published literature.

### GAP 8: Priority Hierarchy Resolution

**What exists:** Frameworks list dimensions without ranking them. "Be clear AND comprehensive AND concise AND creative." These constraints conflict.

**What FORGE does:** ANVIL's Limits dimension (L) includes explicit priority ordering. When accuracy conflicts with completeness, which wins? When brevity conflicts with specificity, which wins? The user decides upfront, and the AI follows the hierarchy.

**Why this matters:** Research from Aakash Gupta's 1,500-paper meta-analysis confirms that structured short prompts outperform verbose prompts when properly constrained. The priority hierarchy IS the constraint that makes brevity work.

**Teaching point:** "Accuracy > Completeness > Style" is more powerful than three paragraphs of instructions because it resolves ambiguity before it occurs.

### GAP 9: Failure Definition

**What exists:** Every framework defines success. None define failure.

**What FORGE does:** ANVIL's Necessity dimension (N) requires the user to articulate what failure looks like. "Failure = recommendations that aren't actionable without additional data." "Failure = analysis that doesn't distinguish our situation from generic industry advice." This gives the AI a boundary to AVOID, not just a target to HIT.

**Why this matters:** Defining failure is more constraining than defining success because success has many valid forms but failure has specific patterns. Telling the AI "don't give me generic advice" is more actionable than "give me specific advice."

**Teaching point:** This is borrowed from engineering (failure mode analysis) and military planning (red team). FORGE is the first prompt engineering system to apply it.

### GAP 10: Emotional Register Specification

**What exists:** "Tone: professional." "Tone: friendly." Single-word emotional descriptors.

**What FORGE does:** ANVIL's Voice dimension (V) includes emotional register — how the READER should FEEL after consuming the output. "The reader should feel informed and slightly challenged." "The reader should feel reassured but motivated to act." This is fundamentally different from tone because it's outcome-oriented rather than style-oriented.

**Why this matters:** The AI can produce professional-toned content that makes the reader feel anxious, or friendly-toned content that makes the reader feel patronized. Tone doesn't control emotional impact. Emotional register does.

**Teaching point:** This comes from rhetoric and speechwriting. No AI prompting guide teaches it.

## PART VIII: TEST HARNESS SPECIFICATION

### Objective
Demonstrate that FORGE-built prompts produce measurably superior output compared to raw prompts and competing frameworks, with a target improvement of 50% on the ASSAY composite score.

### Methodology

**Sample size:** 50 prompts across 5 difficulty tiers (10 per tier)

**Tiers:**
- Tier 1: Simple factual queries
- Tier 2: Structured content creation
- Tier 3: Multi-step analysis
- Tier 4: Strategic decision-making with ambiguity
- Tier 5: Complex multi-constraint tasks with conflicting requirements

**Comparison groups:**
- Group A: Raw prompt (no framework)
- Group B: COSTAR-structured prompt (best established framework)
- Group C: FORGE/ANVIL-built prompt

**Evaluation:**
- Each response scored on ASSAY (5 dimensions × 1-5 scale = 5-25 max)
- Blind evaluation: Scorer does not know which group produced the response
- Three independent scorers per response
- Inter-rater reliability measured via Cohen's kappa
- Statistical significance via paired t-test (p < 0.05)

**Success criteria:**
- FORGE (Group C) composite ASSAY score ≥ 50% higher than raw (Group A)
- FORGE (Group C) composite ASSAY score ≥ 25% higher than COSTAR (Group B)
- FORGE achieves ≥ 4.0 average on each individual ASSAY dimension
- Results replicated across at least 2 different AI models (Claude, ChatGPT)

### Publication Plan

  Score < 15? → Feedback to ANVIL → refine prompt → re-submit
        ↓
  Score ≥ 15 → Gate 7.5 (counter-thesis check)
        ↓
  Counter-thesis present? → DELIVER
        ↓
  Counter-thesis absent? → Generate counter-thesis → DELIVER
        ↓
  PHOENIX captures session state → persistent storage
```

This closed loop is what makes FORGE a SYSTEM, not a framework. Frameworks are static. Systems are dynamic. Nobody else has built a system.

## PART X: UNIVERSAL INTAKE & INTERACTIVE REFINEMENT (v10.1 Amendment)

**Added:** February 10, 2026 | **Origin:** Principal directive during Magai M3 contest image generation — a two-day process that should have taken two hours revealed that FORGE's intake model was too narrow and its output model was single-path when it should be multi-path.

### The Problem FORGE v10.0 Doesn't Solve

FORGE v10.0 assumes the user arrives with a typed goal statement. Reality: users arrive with ANYTHING. A dropped image. A 100-page PDF. An email they want to respond to. A URL. A half-formed question. A screenshot. A CSV file. Code that's broken. A voice transcript. FORGE must accept ALL of these as first-contact input and derive the user's intent from observation, not interrogation.

### Amendment 1: Universal Intake Parser

**Principle:** FORGE accepts any input type. No restrictions on format, length, or medium. The system observes what was provided and begins from there.

**Accepted input types:**
- Raw text (questions, prompts, statements, stream of consciousness)
- Images (screenshots, photographs, diagrams, charts, AI-generated art)
- Documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, TXT, MD, CSV — any file type)
- URLs and web page links
- Emails (full threads or single messages)
- Code (any language, any state — working, broken, partial)
- Audio transcripts
- Multiple inputs simultaneously (e.g., an image + a question + a document)

**Content Gate:** No content unfitting Ashes2Echoes values will be accepted. The existing safety list applies at the intake layer. Prohibited content is rejected before the question flow begins. This is non-negotiable and operates as Gate 0.

**Intake Analysis Protocol:**
1. FORGE receives input
2. FORGE classifies input type(s) — text, image, document, code, URL, mixed
3. FORGE extracts observable signals — topic, domain, complexity, emotional register, urgency
4. FORGE generates an intake hypothesis — "Based on what you've provided, I believe you're looking for [X]. Let me confirm."
5. FORGE proceeds to the question flow with the hypothesis as the baseline

**What this replaces:** The v10.0 assumption that users type "Goal: [statement]" into a text field. That assumption was wrong. Users in the real world throw things at AI and expect the AI to figure it out. FORGE must figure it out.

### Amendment 2: Interactive Question Flow (5-6 → 2-3 → Finalize)

**Principle:** FORGE asks questions in two structured rounds to establish the complete ANVIL profile, then finalizes. Questions are presented as selectable options — not open-ended text fields — wherever possible. The user clicks, selects, ranks. Typing is the last resort.

**Round 1 — Establishment (5-6 questions):**
- Presented immediately after the intake hypothesis
- Purpose: establish content domain, goal type, audience, and output format
- Questions are multi-select or single-select with 4-6 options per question
- FORGE adjusts subsequent questions based on selections (branching logic, not linear)
- Teaching is embedded: question options themselves educate the user about what's possible ("Did you know you can request counter-arguments alongside your analysis?")
- At minimum 5, at maximum 6 questions in Round 1 — not more

**Between Rounds — FORGE Responds and Adjusts:**
- FORGE processes Round 1 selections
- FORGE presents a summary: "Here's what I understand so far: [summary]. Now let me dial this in."
- FORGE identifies gaps in the ANVIL profile based on what's still missing
- If the user's selections indicate expertise, FORGE skips beginner-level questions in Round 2
- If the user's selections indicate they're exploring (not sure what they want), FORGE adds orienting questions

**Round 2 — Precision (2-3 questions):**
- Purpose: finish dialing in the remaining ANVIL dimensions
- These questions are specific to what Round 1 revealed as incomplete
- 2 questions minimum, 3 maximum — not more
- By the end of Round 2, all five ANVIL dimensions should have a score ≥ 3

**Subtraction/Edit Options:**
- At any point during the question flow, the user can subtract elements they don't want
- "Remove formal tone" / "Skip the sourcing requirement" / "I don't need a counter-thesis for this"
- FORGE acknowledges the subtraction and adjusts the ANVIL profile accordingly
- Selections should include 4-6 options, not just 4 — give the user room to steer

### Amendment 3: Autonomous Research Phase

**Principle:** Between the question flow and output generation, FORGE conducts autonomous research using all available tools — web search, document analysis, data retrieval, academic databases, code repositories — to inform the output. The user does not direct this research. FORGE decides what needs to be researched based on the ANVIL profile.

**Research triggers:**
- The topic requires current data (market prices, news, policy changes)
- The topic references specific sources that should be verified
- The topic involves technical claims that need validation
- The user's input included a URL or document that needs analysis
- The domain requires specialized knowledge (legal, medical, financial, engineering)

**Research boundaries:**
- FORGE announces that it is conducting research: "Let me pull the latest data on this before I build your response."
- Research duration is bounded — FORGE does not spend 20 minutes searching. It conducts targeted, efficient research.
- Research results are incorporated into the output, not presented as a separate section
- Sources used in research are cited in the output per ASSAY Sourcing requirements

**What this replaces:** The v10.0 flow goes directly from ANVIL scoring to FORGE processing to AI generation. There is no research step. The v10.1 flow inserts autonomous research between ANVIL completion and output generation, ensuring the response is informed by current, verified information — not just the AI's training data.

### Amendment 4: Multi-Draft Selection (2-3 Formats)

**Principle:** Instead of delivering a single output, FORGE generates 2-3 alternative responses that represent different strategic approaches to the same request. The user selects which direction aligns with their intent. Then FORGE finalizes.

**How it works:**
1. FORGE completes the ANVIL profile and conducts research
2. FORGE identifies 2-3 meaningfully different approaches to the request
   - These are NOT tone variations (formal vs. casual)
   - These ARE strategic variations (aggressive vs. conservative, comprehensive vs. focused, narrative vs. analytical)
3. FORGE generates a concise preview of each approach (not the full output — a preview)
4. FORGE presents: "Which of these directions aligns more with what you need?"
5. User selects one
6. FORGE generates the full output in the selected direction
7. FORGE asks: "Execute this, or save the prompt for later?"

**What this models:** This is the Grok dual-response pattern applied systematically. Grok shows two responses and lets the user pick. FORGE shows 2-3 strategic directions and lets the user steer before committing compute to the full output. This eliminates the "that's not what I wanted" problem at the cheapest possible point — before the full generation.

**When to skip multi-draft:**
- Simple factual queries (one right answer)
- User explicitly says "just give me the answer"
- Time-critical requests where speed matters more than direction selection
- Follow-up iterations where the direction is already established

This is the complete FORGE v10.1 operational flow. Every step exists because a real failure in a real session demanded it. The two-day image generation marathon that should have been a two-hour process is the case study that proved these amendments necessary.
