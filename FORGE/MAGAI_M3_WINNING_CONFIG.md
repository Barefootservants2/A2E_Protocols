## WINNING PROMPT

Dark photograph of a sacred arch angel battle-born warrior lunging in side profile against black darkness. Late thirties, weathered face, wild thick curly blonde hair, thick 5 o'Clock shadow beard, piercing blue eyes, sun-touched skin. regal but Torn white robe, beaten bright cryptically engraved gold bracers. Channeling white-hot lightning with jagged blue-purple branches between his hands and a visible broad-sword fit for his station with Aramaic engravings on the wide blade that has energy, hand-grip wrapped in the purest gold long enough for both hands, sword is gripped with both hands and raised slightly, real sparks flying everywhere with smoke. Gigantic white feathered wings filling entire frame width, thousands of detailed layered feathers. Near-black background, single harsh light from the arc. Moody cinematic real photography at the highest resolution possible. The final result is for a magazine cover, so leave blank space for two lines of text above his head.

## WHAT WORKED (FORGE LESSONS)

### Model Selection
- Flux 2 Max: Clean but too bright, beautified faces, lost mood
- GPT Image v1.5 High: Not tested in final round
- **Nano Banana Pro at 4K: WINNER** — grittier, moodier, better at dark atmospherics and raw energy rendering

### Prompt Architecture
- **Under 100 words** — concise emotional direction beats exhaustive technical specification
- **Mood-first language** — "Dark photograph," "black darkness," "moody cinematic"
- **Character description in plain language** — "weathered face, wild thick curly blonde hair, thick 5 o'clock shadow beard, piercing blue eyes"
- **Direct action description** — "lunging in side profile," "sword is gripped with both hands and raised slightly"
- **Energy described with feeling** — "white-hot lightning with jagged blue-purple branches," "real sparks flying everywhere with smoke"
- **Composition instruction** — "leave blank space for two lines of text above his head" (magazine cover awareness)
- **NO camera specs, NO lens specs, NO ISO numbers, NO film stock references**
- **NO negative prompts or "not CGI" type exclusions**

### Process That Produced The Result
1. Started with short mood-driven prompt
2. Generated
3. Evaluated what was wrong
4. Tweaked ONE element in the prompt
5. Generated again
6. Repeated steps 3-5 until locked

### What FORGE Must Enforce
- Maximum 150 words per image prompt
- Test 2-3 models simultaneously, not 1
- Iterative tweak-generate-evaluate loop (not single-shot perfection)
- Mood and emotion descriptors BEFORE technical descriptors
- Plain language over photography jargon
- Composition/layout instructions as final sentence

## FAILURES TO PREVENT IN FORGE

1. **Encyclopedia prompts** — 500+ word prompts with camera bodies, lens specs, aperture settings, ISO values. Flux and most models ignore or misinterpret these. They add noise, not precision.
2. **Single-model lock-in** — Recommending only one model and iterating prompt language to fix model limitations, instead of testing multiple models with the same prompt.
3. **Image-to-image dependency** — Trying to force reference images when text-only iteration is faster and more flexible.
4. **Over-specification of physical detail** — Describing individual skin pores and feather barb structure when the model needs emotional direction like "weathered" and "battle-born."
5. **Beautification bias** — Not accounting for the fact that most AI image models default to attractive/young/clean unless you aggressively push against it with mood language.
